How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

The diff utility extracts the lines where the two files differ, and by including the sections
where the lines are contained, it provides context.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It removes the burden of tracking different file versions across multiple directories. By going back
and reviewing the history of changes, I could see how the code has evolved, and me as I gain more
experience.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

You have control over relevant points to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit,
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I am not sure, maybe Google Docs are meant for traditional files like word documents and spreadsheets
that are traditionally not linked together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log provides a history of commits and relevant comments help me view the history of the files.
git diff allows me to dig into specific files and look at the changes made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I will always be able to revert to a previous state where things worked.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I would like to use Git for my website
