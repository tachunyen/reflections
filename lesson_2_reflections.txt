What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It tells git to be ready to start tracking the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a space you can use to place files for the same commit.
This can help keep things organized.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

If I am working on a project with related files, I could make a change in
file1, add file1 to the staging area, then work on file2. I can imagine while
working on file2, I might come across areas I would like to change in file1. By
using the staging area, I can make sure commits are only made for significant
changes.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be very helpful for experimental features that I might not
want to add to the master branch until it is mature.
