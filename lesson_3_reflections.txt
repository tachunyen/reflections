When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to share my files or if I have collaborators in a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Having Git automatically stay up-to-date with the remote repository might
  cause undesired changes to be saved. Manually pulling changes prevents that,
  sort of like the staging area.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks are like clones but exist remotely within Github only. Clones are
  local copies of a repository while branches exist within a repository.
  Using forks instead of clones on a remote repository allows collaborators
  to work on the particular fork easily. Branches are for testing code or
  feature within a project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  Allows you to work offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
  I would use Dropbox. Easier if I am the only one working on a file, but
  changes are not tracked. It would be harder if more than one person needs
  to work on the same file.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly
in master? What benefits does each approach have?
  If I am collaborating with someone. Working directly on the master reduces
  the complication of merging, but my collaborators might not agree with my
  changes.
