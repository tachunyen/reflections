When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to share my files or if I have collaborators in a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Having Git automatically stay up-to-date with the remote repository might
  cause undesired changes to be saved. Manually pulling changes prevents that,
  sort of like the staging area.
