When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I want to share my files or if I have collaborators in a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Having Git automatically stay up-to-date with the remote repository might
  cause undesired changes to be saved. Manually pulling changes prevents that,
  sort of like the staging area.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
  Forks are like clones but exist remotely within Github only. Clones are
  local copies of a repository while branches exist within a repository.
  Using forks instead of clones on a remote repository allows collaborators
  to work on the particular fork easily. Branches are for testing code or
  feature within a project.
